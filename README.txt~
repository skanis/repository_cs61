NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any): In order to remember how to use the functions in the linkedlist where I store the size and allocated boolean for each allocation in the malloc, I searched online to find these functions - how to delete a node and create one. I took their content and adjusted it to our pset.



EXTRA CREDIT ATTEMPTED (if any): Not attempted
